# React Counter App

## The project

Create a react counter application implementing useReducer Hook and a custom Hook.

### List of pages

These components make up what a user experiences when they check out **The Counter App**. Each page contains componets that are called to the specific page within the app. These components can be located in [./src/components](./src/components).

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Home.js](./src/pages/Home.js) | The landing page a user sees when they navigate to the **Counter App**. |
| [Mainpage.vue](./src/pages/mainPage.js)   | The main counter app. There's a link to go to the custom Hook implementation. |
| [CustomHook.js](./src/pages/customHook.js) | Page where users can see the other users they've matched with. A match occurs when two users have liked each other. |
